# Multiple Linear Regression

In this project, I implemented a **Multiple Linear Regression** model using **Scikit-learn**.  
I trained and tested the model on a **real-world dataset** to predict a continuous target variable based on multiple independent features.

## **Objectives**

After completing this project, I was able to:

- Use **Scikit-learn** to implement **Multiple Linear Regression**.
- Create, train, and test a regression model on real data.
- Understand how multiple independent variables affect the prediction.
- Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.

## **Project Overview**

Multiple Linear Regression is used when we predict a **continuous target variable** using **two or more features**.  
In this project, I followed these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded and explored the dataset.
   - Handled missing values.
   - Scaled numerical features where necessary.

2. **Model Training**
   - Used **Scikit-learn's LinearRegression** module.
   - Trained the model on the dataset.

3. **Model Testing**
   - Evaluated performance using metrics like:
     - **R² Score**
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

4. **Visualization**
   - Plotted regression lines.
   - Visualized feature importance and residuals.
